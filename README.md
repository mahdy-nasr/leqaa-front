# Project Description: Leqaa

  

During Hajj Hackathon, more than 3000 participants, organizers and service partners represented a micro and overly simplified Hajj simulation, for young and energetic people. Moving in buses between limited number of locations still created an overwhelming engagement for some people. Imaging, the real Hajj season with 1000 times more people moving between various locations, requiring logistics, healthcare and other services. The prospective magnitude of Hajj is ever increasing on yearly basis. To manage all that, the right technological solutions could come in real handy. Hence Leqaa as the first solution of its kind for Hajj convoys and individual hajis.

The project is to build a portal with both front and back end to provide communication and location services to help Hajj convoy supervisors collaborate with individual hajis to avoid missing any convoy member when moving from one location to the other. Also, it helps individual hajis find their own way back in case they are lost during Hajj season. The app helps get hajis reunited with their own convoys, even if they do not have smartphones. Saudi government will be able to know locations of convoy supervisors and hajis at all times, to help keep hajis safe and united with their own convoys.

## Project Features:

-   Saudi Government agencies will be able to identify potential issue related to hajis splitting from their own convoys. Also, live location data can be used to predict congestions, traffic jams and missing people.
    
-   Convoy supervisors will be able to prepare preset schedules of how they will move from one location to the other and set dates and times for those movements. Additionally, they will be able to amend the schedule and announce new events and changes to their fellow hajis.
    
-   Hajis will be constantly updated on the next movement/event date and time, as well as receive announcement from supervisors.
    
-   In the frequent event of a haji losing track of his or her own convoy, they will be able to go to the next point in schedule through GPS navigation. However, in case haji is not carrying a smartphone, he or she can simply walk up to any other haji with a smartphone, get their QR code scanned. Once scanned, the following will happen automatically:
    

-   Notification will be sent about the lost haji to the relevant supervisor, with information on his or her location, the language of the owner of the smartphone. Chat channel can be opened immediately.
    
-   Smartphone will immediately identify the nearest volunteer and communicate with them to help the lost haji. System would automatically give preference to the volunteer that speaks the lost hajiâ€™s language.
    

-   Any haji can activate a volunteer mode, and help other elderly or sick ones within vicinity. Such an option would reduce government financial burden and make people safer by reuniting lost people with their groups.
    

  

## Deep Impact:

The use of Leqaa solution will forever change the Hajj experience, making a safer, more informed and comfortable. Making all stakeholder, Government, Convoy Managements and Individual Hajis real partners in making Hajj season an unforgettable spiritual experience.
